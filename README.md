# Os
Lets make a community operating system where everyone can contribute
Okay, so there is some applications it needs to have:
Settings
Maybe Chromium (the chromium project)
Calendar
Wifi Access
file explorer
A certain type of new file it can open (Windows Opens .exe, Mac Os X opens .pkg files, debian besed linux opens .deb files)
We also need a color scheme (Windows Xp has blue and green, Os X has grey and silver, etc.)
Add whatever else; also I kinda want it to be able to run in a virtualbox file so we can run it.
